# Clipman

The main goal of developing the Clipman was to create a simple clipboard manager extension for GNOME that isn't overloaded with features and settings. Unfortunately, the current analogues of this type of extensions have redundant functionality, while not providing the functionality I need.

| Shortcut          | Action                                                |
| ----------------- |------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Space` / `Enter` | Activate the selected entry                           |
| `*`               | Pin/unpin the selected entry                          |
| `Delete`          | Delete the selected entry                             |
| `UpArrow`         | Select the entry above                                |
| `DownArrow`       | Select the entry below                                |
| `RightArrow`      | Open the actions submenu                              |
| `LeftArrow`       | Close the actions submenu                             |
| `/`               | Move keyboard focus to the search field               |
| `Escape`          | Clear the search field (if focused) or close the menu |
